                  propellers that are working in group. Drones that possess large number of motors inside can gain more control over

                  source and most of these devices contain removable batteries so that it can stay in air for long run. The flight
                   time can be extended with use of powerful batteries in design.

                British</strong> initiated use of very basic model of drones in <strong> early 1940’s</strong> to scout on the 
                <strong> Axis powers</strong>. Present day drones are leading-edge than the UAVs of previous years which is equipped 
                with thermal imaging, laser range finder and even tools to perform airstrike. They are used as decoys to 
                conduct military missions. UAV’s will continue to be applied various military operations due to their high 
                accessibility in reducing losses and enabling the execution of high profit and time-sensitive mission.

                Safety is a primary concern when dealing with unmanned aerial vehicles. To avoid mid-air collisions, 
                UAVs must be programmed with <strong> “sense and avoid” capabilities that match those of manned aircraft</strong>. 
                This means that drones must be able to <strong> detect a potential collision and maneuver to safety</strong>. 
                In the event of system failures, falling drones are another serious danger, especially when they are used near
